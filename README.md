**Structure**
-----------
------------
This code was built using `def` methods and a `case` statement.

The `def` keyword tells the Ruby interpreter that we're defining a method. This was used in the code to define the methods **hello_user** and **operation**.

The `case` statement allows us to choose between the options of the calculator.
